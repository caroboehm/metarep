## Definitions

--- 

### Definition: Replication (Y) 

- Find a working definition for 'replication' 
- Operationalization? -- replication success
- Brainstorm & obtain feedback 

#### Solutions (?)
    
    > "There is no simple decision rule for declaring success of failure in
    > replication for detecting positive results" 
    >
    > --(Klein et al. 2018)

2 Aspects:

1. Replication rates (Y1)
2. Heterogeneity (Y2)

- Bejnamin et al. (2018)
- Cramer et al. (2018)
- Open Science Collaboration (2015)
- Gelman (20xx)

### Definition: Adhoc (invalidated) scale

- When is a scale in/-validated? 

### Modified scale

    > "Deviations from preexisting, validated scales"

(Most common) 'modifications':
1. Reduced number of items
2. Item wording
3. Response format
    - Number of response options
    - Scale polarity
    - Labeling response option

### Relationship: Adhoc scale ~ Modified scales

- How does 'adhocery' relate to modification?
- Are there deviations which lead to 'invalidation' and 'modification'?
- If so, which ones?

This is relevant for the construction of the DAG! 

--- 

## Negative framing problem

- Is there a situation in which changing a scale is harmless?
- Circumstances? 

--- 

## Sensibility Analysis 

A problem of 'faulty' analysis? Crux: Is our inference dependent on others
techniques, results and conclusions?

- Get original data sets (if possible) and reanalyze

---

## Miscellaneous

- Integrate info into a DAG
- Can we do anything with entropy scores? (Negative framing problem)
    - see: Corona Paper
- GESIS Panel -- items
